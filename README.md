# dsp_lab

These 4 exercises were done for the digital signal processing (DSP) subject.

The first [/exercise1](/exercise1) is about sampling and reconstructing signals with [/exercise1/sampling_reconstruction.m](/sampling_reconstruction.m)
file. All observations done about:
1) The errors depending on the sampling frequency
2) The differencies between conv() and filter() Matlab built-in functions
3) The remaining frequencies after reconstruction
4) The plots

can be found in the  [/exercise1/Report.pdf](/Report.pdf)
